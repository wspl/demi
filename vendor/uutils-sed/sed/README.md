# sed

Rust reimplementation of the [sed utility](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/sed.html)
with some [GNU sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html),
[FreeBSD sed](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?sed(1)),
and other extensions.

## Status

At this state _sed_ implements all [POSIX features](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/)
and can run correctly the two complex scripts of its integration tests:
[hanoi.sed](https://github.com/uutils/sed/blob/main/tests/fixtures/sed/script/hanoi.sed) (solves the Towers of Hanoi puzzle) and
[math.sed](https://github.com/uutils/sed/blob/main/tests/fixtures/sed/script/math.sed)  (implements an arbitrary precision integer math calculator).

The performance of this Rust implementation is now better than the GNU and FreeBSD implementations for most benchmarked cases.

Further work aims to:
* Adjust buffering on terminal output to match current implementations,
* Implement more GNU extensions,
* Improve performance where possible.

## Installation and Use

We provide a Linux x86_64 binary archive from the main branch at
https://github.com/uutils/sed/releases/tag/latest-commit .

For other platforms, ensure you have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust through [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Clone the repository and build the project using Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uutils/sed.git
cd sed
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```

The binary is named `sed` in `target/release/sed`.

You can also try *sed* on the web
through the [uutils Playground](https://uutils.org//playground/)
by clicking on the `Load sed` button.

## Testing

### GNU sed Compatibility Testing

Test compatibility against GNU sed by running the upstream testsuite shell scripts
with a lightweight gnulib test-framework shim:

```bash
# Clone GNU sed testsuite (one time setup)
git clone https://github.com/mirror/sed.git ../gnu.sed

# Run compatibility tests
./util/run-gnu-testsuite.sh

# Verbose mode shows failure details
./util/run-gnu-testsuite.sh -v

# Generate JSON results for CI
./util/run-gnu-testsuite.sh --json-output results.json
```

The harness executes each `.sh` test from the GNU sed testsuite directly, injecting
our Rust sed binary via `PATH` and providing shim implementations of the gnulib test
framework functions (`compare_`, `returns_`, `skip_`, etc.).

### Unit Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

## Extensions and incompatibilities
### Supported GNU extensions
* Command-line arguments can be specified in long (`--`) form.
* Spaces can precede a regular expression modifier.
* `I` can be used in as a synonym for the `i` (case insensitive) substitution
  flag.
* `M` and `m` substitution flags allow multi-line matching.
* In addition to `\n`, other escape sequences (octal, hex, C) are supported
  in the strings of the `y` command.
  Under POSIX these yield undefined behavior.
* The `a`, `c`, and `i` commands do not require an initial backslash,
  allow text to appear on the same line, and support escape sequences
  in the specified text.
* The `a`, `i`, `=`, `l`, `q` and `r` commands support address range as an extension to POSIX.
* The substitution command replacement group `\0` is a synonym for &.
* A `Q` command (optionally followed by an exit code) quits immediately.
* The `q` command can be optionally followed by an exit code.
* The `l` command can be optionally followed by the output width.
* The `--follow-symlinks` option for in-place editing.
* The `--sandbox` option that limits potentially destructive commands.
* Address 0 can be used to specify an address range that is already
  active on line 1 and can finish with the specified regular expression.
* Address steps can be specified in the form of start~step and start,~step
  ranges.
* Address 0 can be used in the `r` command to prepend a file.

### Supported BSD and GNU extensions
* The second address in a range can be specified as a relative address with +N.
* In-place editing of file with the `-i` flag.

### New extensions
* Unicode characters can be specified in regular expression pattern, replacement
  and transliteration sequences using `\uXXXX` or `\UXXXXXXXX` sequences.
* The `l` command lists Unicode characters using the `\uXXXX` and `\UXXXXXXXX`
  sequences.

### Incompatibilities
* Similarly to GNU _sed_, input is processed as raw bytes or as valid UTF-8
  (this includes 7-bit ASCII) based on the locale as specified by the
  `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, and `LANG` environment variables,
  with the default being byte processing.
  However, in contrast with GNU _sed_, other locales (e.g. ISO-8859-1)
  are not supported. If the input is in another code page or encoding
  and requires locale-specific processing (e.g. ignore/map case,
  character classes), consider converting it through UTF-8 to ensure
  the correct handling of locale-specific regular expressions.
  This _sed_ program can also handle arbitrary byte sequences
  if no part of the input requires treating it as a Rust String.
* Back-references aren't supported when input is processed as bytes
  (`LC_ALL=C`).
* The command will report an error and fail if duplicate labels are found
  in the script.
  This matches the BSD behavior. The GNU version accepts duplicate labels.
* The last line (`$`) address is interpreted as the last non-empty line of
  the last file.  If files specified in subsequent arguments until the last
  one are empty, then the last line condition will never be triggered.
  This behavior is consistent with the
  [original implementation](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7/usr/src/cmd/sed/sed1.c#L665).
* Labels are parsed for alphanumeric characters. The BSD version parses them
  until the end of the line, preventing ; to be used as a separator.

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes.
