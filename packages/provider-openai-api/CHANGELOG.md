# @demicodes/provider-openai-api

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Align all public packages on 0.3.0. Highlights of this release: correct
  Claude Code context-usage reporting (no more spurious compaction on long
  tool-heavy sessions) and session storage phase 1 — role-based
  Status/View/Checkpoint/Artifact naming and bounded tool views that shrink
  session checkpoints from tens of MB to content-proportional size.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish with a runnable dependency closure: `@demicodes/just-bash`
  3.0.1-demi.5 ships the full dist its deep-path exports point at (0.2.0
  installed but could not run), and intra-workspace dependencies publish as
  caret ranges instead of exact pins so future patch releases do not require
  republishing every dependent.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Align the workspace on 0.2.0: byte-clean binary pipelines with a model-media
  boundary, the --help flag replacing the prompt pseudo-subcommand, hardened
  command bridge execution (ephemeral shells, byte-identical stdin), unified
  provider quota surfaces, the multi-credential pool with a global active
  switch, and tool-result media delivery for OpenAI-compatible and Claude Code
  transports.

### Patch Changes

- 0bcb313: Merge helper duplicates into their owning packages: `errorCode` (errno-style
  code guard) joins `@demicodes/utils`; `numberHeader`, `redactCredentialText`,
  and `toolResultContentToText` join the `@demicodes/provider` kit and replace
  the per-provider copies in codex, claude-code, grok-build, and openai-api.
  The shared tool-result flattener renders `[<type>:<mediaType>]`, so the
  openai-api provider now labels video blocks `[video:…]` instead of `[image:…]`.
- 09bcc0d: Tool results carrying images on the Responses wire now reach the model:
  `function_call_output` stays text (gateways drop or reject media inside it),
  and the images ride a follow-up user message labeled with the call id. The
  agent layer only attaches media the model's catalog accepts, so text-only
  models see no behavior change. Verified end to end against a live
  vision-capable Responses endpoint.
