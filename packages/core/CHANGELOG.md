## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- ca71716: Publish tarballs without the `development` export condition. The condition
  resolves to ./src for in-repo workspace resolution, but dist-only tarballs do
  not ship src — and dev-mode bundlers (Vite) enable the development condition
  by default, so consumers resolved exports to files that do not exist. The
  release pipeline now strips the condition at pack time and validates that
  every packed export target actually exists in the tarball.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish with resolved internal dependency ranges. The 0.3.0 tarballs shipped
  literal `workspace:^` ranges because the release went through `changeset
publish` (npm does not rewrite the workspace protocol); 0.3.0 is deprecated.
  The release pipeline now packs and publishes with bun and validates every
  tarball's manifest before anything is pushed to the registry.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Align all public packages on 0.3.0. Highlights of this release: correct
  Claude Code context-usage reporting (no more spurious compaction on long
  tool-heavy sessions) and session storage phase 1 — role-based
  Status/View/Checkpoint/Artifact naming and bounded tool views that shrink
  session checkpoints from tens of MB to content-proportional size.
- c352335: Session storage phase 1: role-based naming and bounded tool views (see
  docs/session-storage-and-naming.md).

  Renames — one word per role, "snapshot" retired: `ShellCommandSnapshot` →
  `ShellCommandStatus`, `StreamArtifact`/`ShellOutputArtifact` →
  `ShellStreamView`/`ShellOutputView`, `PersistedShellCommandArtifact` →
  `CommandArtifact`, `AgentSessionSnapshot` → `AgentSessionCheckpoint`
  (`checkpoint.json`, `saveCheckpoint`/`loadCheckpoint`,
  `AgentSession.fromCheckpoint`), agent class `Transcript` → `TranscriptLog`
  (with `toJSON()`), frames `transcript_snapshot` → `transcript_reset` and
  `shell_output.snapshot` → `.status`, tool_call block `metadata` → `view`.

  Bounded views — `toShellToolResult` no longer dumps the whole command status
  into the block: it stores a `ShellToolView` (commandId reference plus a
  32 KiB tail render window) instead of 3–4 duplicate stdout encodings, raw
  binary bytes, and triple diff encodings. `demi` file diffs keep `unifiedDiff`
  only. The vestigial `ToolContinuation` channel is removed. Command storage
  moves under the unified `agent-sessions/<id>/` prefix. Fixes multi-MB session
  checkpoints (measured 47.8 MB for a session whose content was ~hundreds of KB).

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish with a runnable dependency closure: `@demicodes/just-bash`
  3.0.1-demi.5 ships the full dist its deep-path exports point at (0.2.0
  installed but could not run), and intra-workspace dependencies publish as
  caret ranges instead of exact pins so future patch releases do not require
  republishing every dependent.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b7b981: Binary streams end to end, attachment channel removed. Pipes are byte-clean
  through real OS processes in both directions (`hostSpawn` stdin/stdout were
  UTF-8-lossy); the exec boundary classifies the final stream — valid UTF-8 is
  text, anything else surfaces as `binaryStdout` (raw bytes, truncation-aware)
  with a placeholder text render. The agent layer sniffs the closed model-media
  set by magic bytes and attaches image/video blocks when the model accepts the
  type, explaining why otherwise. `CommandAsset` / `io.asset()` and every
  `supportedAssetTypes` thread are gone; `demi read` emits raw file bytes
  (media presentation happens at the boundary); the command bridge carries
  binary stdout as base64 and the shim writes raw bytes to its OS stdout.
- 10dbc6b: Native video input support (no frame extraction) plus a per-model modality marker.

  - `core` gains `video` content blocks (`UserContentBlock` / `ToolResultContentBlock`,
    with `VideoSource` / `Base64VideoSource`), video file extensions on
    `FileExtension`, and the shared video capability helpers.
  - `provider` gains `ProviderModel.supportsVideo` — the marker for whether a model
    accepts native video. A model's `acceptedExtensions` now includes the shared
    core video extensions only when it marks video support.
  - `shell` `CommandAsset` and `agent`'s tool-result mapping carry video assets end to end,
    so a command can emit a video the same way it emits an image.
  - Providers whose API has no video content type (Claude Code, Anthropic) degrade video
    blocks defensively; the marker keeps video from being attached to them in the first place.

- Align the workspace on 0.2.0: byte-clean binary pipelines with a model-media
  boundary, the --help flag replacing the prompt pseudo-subcommand, hardened
  command bridge execution (ephemeral shells, byte-identical stdin), unified
  provider quota surfaces, the multi-credential pool with a global active
  switch, and tool-result media delivery for OpenAI-compatible and Claude Code
  transports.

### Patch Changes

- 2af7114: Residue cleanup: `supportedAssetTypesFor(model)` in core replaces two inline
  ternaries; the codex/grok text redactors get unambiguous vendor names
  (`redactCodexSecretText`, private grok equivalent) instead of shadowing the
  provider kit's differently-typed `redactSecretText`; claude-code quota parses
  the unified-utilization header via the shared `numberHeader`; leftover
  `editor` naming from the demi rename is gone from comments, docs, and test
  fixtures; and the real-spawn exclusions (`bash`/`sh`/`sleep`) are documented
  as a routing decision rather than a wrapper workaround.
